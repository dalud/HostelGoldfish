# Hostel Goldfish
was a school project that didn't meet the deadline. Realized using [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) the aim was to create a
graphical online chatroom (in the vein of Habbo Hotel etc).
Despite my best efforts I couldn't get the textbox/chat/speechbubble -functionality working to a satisfactory level in time.
SO... currently there's really not much more to do in the "game" other than walk around and bump into walls.
But hey! At least the music's great!
